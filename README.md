# Mini Project - Smart Security Surveillance Using IoT

Here, I've made a smart security surveillance using IoT. In this Project , I used a Raspberry pi, Raspberry pi cammera module and a PIR motion sensor.
I have implemented a simple python code to send an email message with picture (or) video to the admin, whenever a person comes in front of the PIR motion sensor.
I used MobaXterm to run the secured shell(SSH) Python program in Raspberry Pi forever.
